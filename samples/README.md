# Checked C
Checked C is an extension to C that adds static and dynamic checking to detect or prevent common programming
errors such as buffer overruns, out-of-bounds memory accesses, and incorrect type casts.   This repo contains the
specification for the extension, test code, and samples. For the latest version of the specification and the 
draft of the next version, see the [Checked C releases page](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc/releases).

We are creating a modified version of LLVM/clang that supports Checked C.   The code for the modified
version of LLVM/clang lives in the 
[Checked C clang repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang)
and the [Checked C LLVM repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-llvm).

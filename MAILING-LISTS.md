# Mailing Lists

There are two mailing lists for the Checked C project:

* checkedc-announce: this is a low-traffic mailing list for announcements about the
project, such as the availability of new versions of specifications  and  implementations.
* checkedc-discussion: this is for discussing the design and
implementation of Checked C and for questions about Checked C.  Weekly status
updates are sent to this list.

The email lists are open to anyone involved in the project.  They are not confidential, so
please do not include confidential or proprietary information in emails sent to the lists.

## Joining

To join the mailing lists, send an email to listserv@lists.research.microsoft.com with a 
message body containing the word SUBSCRIBE followed by the name of the mailing list
(either CHECKEDC-ANNOUNCE or CHECKEDC-DISCUSSION).

To leave a mailing list, send an email to listserv@lists.research.microsoft.com with a 
message body containing the word UNSUBSCRIBE followed by the name of the mailing list.

## Using the lists

To email a list, send email to NAME@lists.research.microsoft.com, where NAME is either
checkedc-announce or checkedc-discussion.

These email lists are for anyone involved in or interested in the Checked C project.
For specific issues about a specification or implementation, you can open an issue using 
the Github issue tracking system.  If in doubt, feel free to send an email to the discussion
list.   If we think something should be tracked using an issue, we'll ask you to open one
or open one ourselves.
